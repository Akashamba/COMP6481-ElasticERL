# COMP6481-ElasticERL
ElasticERL Data Structure created for the project component of COMP 6481 - Programming and Problem Solving taught by Dr. Aiman Hanna at Concordia University in Winter 23

ElasticERL is a versatile Abstract Data Type (ADT) developed to efficiently manage and organize equipment history reports. It sorts data by Equipment Identification Number (EIN) and entry order, offering quick retrieval of both predecessor and successor entries.

ElasticERL adapts to different dataset sizes, utilizing expandable arrays for smaller data to conserve memory, and switching to a custom-designed AVL Tree for larger datasets, ensuring faster sorting and retrieval with optimal memory usage.
