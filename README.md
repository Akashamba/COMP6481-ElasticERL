ElasticERL: A Smart ADT for Equipment History Report Management

Developed a versatile Abstract Data Type (ADT) named ElasticERL, designed to efficiently manage and sort equipment history reports. ElasticERL organizes data by Equipment Identification Number (EIN) and the order of entry, with capabilities to retrieve both successor and predecessor entries.

The ADT dynamically adjusts to varying data sizes, utilizing expandable arrays for smaller datasets to minimize memory usage and a custom-designed AVL Tree for larger datasets, enhancing sorting and retrieval speeds while maintaining optimal memory efficiency.
